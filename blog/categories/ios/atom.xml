<h2>1. 字符（Characters） 与 字体（Glyph）</h2>

<p>这是我的<code>第一篇博客</code>，谢谢访问。</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<blockquote><p>A <code>字符</code> is the smallest unit of written language that carries meaning .</p></blockquote>

<h3>Glyph</h3>

<blockquote><p>Any one of these various concrete forms of a <strong>character</strong> is called a <code>Glyph</code> .</p></blockquote>

<h3>Ligatures</h3>

<blockquote><p>In some case a character may be represented by multiple glyphs. In other cases, a single glyph may represnet multiple charaters,as in the case of a <code>ligature</code>, or joined letter.</p></blockquote>

<h2>2. Typefaces and Fonts</h2>

<h3>Typeface</h3>

<blockquote><p>A <code>typeface</code>(also known as font family) is a set of visually related shapes for some or all of the characters in a written language.</p>

<p>from Wikipedia:
a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts).</p>

<p>A <code>typestyle</code>, or simply style(also called traits), is a distinguishing visual characteristic of a typeface, such as,  such as bold, italic, condensed, expanded, narrow, small caps, poster fonts, and fixed pitch.</p></blockquote>

<h3>字体和字体簇</h3>

<blockquote><p>A <code>font</code> is a series of glyphs depicting the characters in a consistent size, typeface, and typestyle.
A <code>font family</code> (also known as Typeface) is a group of fonts that share a typeface but differ in typestyle.</p></blockquote>

<h2>3. Text Layout</h2>

<blockquote><p>Text <code>layout</code> is the process of arranging glyphs on a display device, in an area called a text view , which represents an area similar to a page in traditional typesetting.</p>

<p>The order in which glyphs are laid out relative to each other is called text <code>direction</code>.</p>

<p>To create lines from a string of glyphs, the layout engine must perform <code>line breaking</code> by finding a point at which to end one line and begin the next.</p>

<p>The layout manager lays out glyphs along an invisible line called the <code>baseline</code>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>4. Tips</h2>

<pre><code>Characters and glyphs do not have one-to-one correspondence;
